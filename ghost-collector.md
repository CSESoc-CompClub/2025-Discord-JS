# GHOST COLLECTOR

In this short tutorial, we'll be going over the creation of our very own ghost-collector bot! This will include some of the following features:

- users in the discord channel can prompt for 'ghosts' to spawn, which are just a randomised embed with a ghost and some information about it
- each user can react to claim a ghost as part of their collection - first come first serve!
- users can generate a list of all the ghosts that they currently have.
- trade ghosts with other players and complete all the ghosts of a set!
    - sets will include things like animals, myths, dolls, and more. :D
